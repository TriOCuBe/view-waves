Lightweight mindustry mod that adds a button beneath the wave indicator in the top left corner. Displays the next 100 waves in endless mode, and all the waves until the sector is captured if that is possible. Color codes the next wave, greys out already passed waves and marks Guardians as red. The information for each wave at the moment includes unit name, number and type (flying, ground, hovering etc). Might add more things to it like icons and possibly clickable icons that take you to the codex page, or blurring out names of units the player hasn't encountered already, or bringing this in connection with an in game building like a scanner, but that's quite far away so I won't promise anything. Should technically work with any mod, I've seen some UI clashes with the button though. The button looks ugly even without conflicts, but I haven't managed to understand how to correctly design it yet, so it is what it is.

(Example with New Horizons Mod installed)
